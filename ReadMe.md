#BetterLinks

This is a very basic script that checks threads on /r/jailbreak for thebigboss.org or modmyi.com package depiction links and leaves a comment mentioning that it is better to use cydia.saurik.com links. 

I wrote this a while ago in Python 2.7. I'm not even sure if it will work with the current version of praw. Feel free to open an issue or PR if you have any thing to contribute.
